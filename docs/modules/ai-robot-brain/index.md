# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

This module focuses on implementing perception, navigation, and manipulation pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. You'll learn to create the "brain" of the robot that processes sensory information and makes intelligent decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Launch and configure Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot
- Generate synthetic training data using Isaac Sim
- Implement Visual SLAM (VSLAM) pipeline for localization
- Integrate Nav2 navigation stack for autonomous navigation
- Validate sim-to-real transfer capabilities of trained models
