# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)

## Overview

This module covers the creation and simulation of digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn to simulate robots in virtual environments with physics-based interactions and sensor simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Load and configure humanoid URDF/SDF models in Gazebo simulation
- Configure and test simulated sensors (LiDAR, IMU, Depth Camera)
- Establish synchronization between Gazebo and ROS 2 topics
- Visualize humanoid robot behavior in Unity 3D environment
- Implement realistic physics interactions and collision detection
