# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This module integrates vision, speech, and LLMs into ROS 2 pipelines for conversational humanoid robots that interpret commands and act autonomously. You'll learn to create systems that can understand natural language and execute complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Capture voice commands using Whisper or similar ASR systems
- Translate natural language to ROS 2 actions via Large Language Models
- Execute actions in simulation environment with feedback
- Integrate vision-based object perception with language understanding
- Implement cognitive planning for complex task execution
