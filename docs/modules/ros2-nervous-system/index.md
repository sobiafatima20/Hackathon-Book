# Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

## Overview

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots. You'll learn to implement the communication framework that allows different components of a robot to interact seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and its role as a robotic communication framework
- Create and configure ROS 2 workspaces with proper package structure
- Implement nodes in Python and C++ that communicate via topics and services
- Design humanoid robot models using URDF format
- Integrate AI agents with ROS 2 using `rclpy` client library
