# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource for students, early-career engineers, and developers transitioning from digital AI to physical robotics.

## Overview

This technical book provides hands-on learning experiences with:
- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** for robotic communication
- **Gazebo and Unity** for digital twin simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for AI perception and planning
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems** for conversational robotics

## Book Structure

The book is organized into 4 educational modules:

### [Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/)
Learn to implement the communication framework for humanoid robots using ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and URDF-based robot descriptions.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)](./modules/digital-twin/)
Simulate humanoid robots in virtual environments using Gazebo and Unity with physics-based interactions and sensor simulation.

### [Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./modules/ai-robot-brain/)
Implement perception, navigation, and manipulation pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./modules/vla-system/)
Integrate vision, speech, and LLMs into ROS 2 pipelines for conversational humanoid robots that interpret commands and act autonomously.

## Learning Approach

Each module includes:
- Clear learning objectives and concepts
- Diagrams and pseudocode for better understanding
- Reproducible lab exercises with step-by-step instructions
- Technical references and verified citations
- Troubleshooting guides and validation scripts
