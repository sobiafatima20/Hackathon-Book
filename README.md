# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book

A comprehensive educational resource for students, early-career engineers, and developers transitioning from digital AI to physical robotics. This book covers 4 educational modules: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System, Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity), AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Overview

This technical book provides hands-on learning experiences with:
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill for robotic communication
- Gazebo and Unity for digital twin simulation
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for AI perception and planning
- Vision-Language-Action systems for conversational robotics

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended)
- 50GB+ free disk space
- Node.js 18+ and npm

## Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sobiafatima20/Hackathon-Book.git
cd Hackathon-Book
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the documentation site:
```bash
npm start
```

## Book Structure

The book is organized into 4 modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System** - Learn to implement the communication framework for humanoid robots
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)** - Simulate robots in virtual environments
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Implement perception and navigation systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Create conversational humanoid robots

Each module includes:
- Learning objectives and concepts
- Diagrams and pseudocode
- Reproducible lab exercises
- References and citations

## Development
